  storyText: "You set off with blazing speed as you chase after the deer. You come
    to a sudden halt as the deer is swept away from your vision and lifted into the
    sky to meet with a pair of hungry teeth that snaps its body in two.\r\n\r\nYour
    eyes meet with the dragon's and for a moment both of you freeze as you calculate
    your next move...\r\n\r\n1. Slowly back away towards the woods.\r\n\r\n2. Draw
    your knife to take on this beast!\r\n\r\n3. Fire an arrow to warn the dragon that
    you are a serious force to be reckoned with."
