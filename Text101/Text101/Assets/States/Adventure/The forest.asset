  storyText: "You keep backing away slowly and finally you reach the forest with trees
    as cover. You slip behind a tree and the dragon loses its focus of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
    Stay behind the tree. It won't find me here.\r\n\r\n2. Move from tree to tree
    towards the castle, but take the risk of being seen by the dragon."
