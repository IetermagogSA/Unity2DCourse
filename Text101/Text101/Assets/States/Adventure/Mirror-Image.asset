  storyText: "You realize that it would be stupid to fight in an open area and decide
    to back away into the woods where there is more cover.\r\n\r\nWith every step
    you take towards the woods, the dragon takes a step forward as if its mirroring
    your movements.\r\n\r\n1. Keep doing what you're doing until you reach the woods.\r\n\r\n2.
    Turn around and start running to the woods."
