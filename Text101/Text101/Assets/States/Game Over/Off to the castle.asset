  storyText: "Its useless to fight and you set off running as fast as you can towards
    the castle gates. The dragon chases you with all its blazing fury, but only manages
    to match your pace and stay behind you. You cross the bridge and a guard behind
    the gate raises the draw-bridge.\r\n\r\nYou escape by the hair on your chin, but
    only as a running coward.\n\nWould you like to try again?\n1. Yes\n2. No"
